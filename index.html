            <h1>What To Do If You Encounter A Wild Animal</h1>
            <p>
                It is important to care and protect wild animals as the can not physically protect their environment when it come to the
                interferance of human behaviour to their environment by themself.
                
                Humans need to protect all wild anima as they are part of our shared environment.
                
                Humans have the power to effect the environment on a large scale and need to be responsible for their actions.
                
                We have already done so much damage to the environment of many different animal species.
                
                And think who else is going to protect them from threats outside of their control.

                We have already done so much damage to the environment of many different animal species.
                
                And think who else is going to protect them from threats outside of their control.
                One of the reasons that we are so keen to get out into the wilderness is for the wildlife so that we can be close to it
                and see wild animals passing close to us, or just watch from a distance.
                <br><br>
                When it all works out and we take some nice photographs from a safe distance, we regard it as a great trip, but things
                can get scary when they get too close for comfort.
                <br><br>
                Sometimes you also may have a close encounter with one of our more dangerous wild animals, and your reactions in those
                situations could be crucial to your safety and survival.

               <p>
                The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It has a muscular,
                deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic;
                adult male lions have a prominent mane.

           <p>
                There are many things that provoke wild animals to attack, so whatever you do, try to avoid doing them!<br><br> Do these steps:
                <br><br>   
                Do not approach and surprise an Animal <br>
                    Do not startle a mother with her babies <br> 
                    Don’t go off the trail after dark <br>
                    Do not get close to their food source <br>
                    Do not get too close to them <br>
                    Do not feed animals <br>
                    Don't try to pet the animals
                
            </p><br>  
              
            <div class="rm">
                <h2>Bear</h2>
                <img src="images/bear.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you see a bear close to you, make sure you stay calm and stand your ground while waving your hands slowly above your
                head and do not try to run away or turn you back to the bear.               
                A bear is most likely to attack if it feels that her cubs are in danger. So if you see baby bears, stay away from them
                since the mother is probably very close by. Also, if the bear huffs or stomps a paw, make sure you give it space and
                back off.                      
                If there’s a group of you all do it at the same time, having a group can be a very effective deterrent.</p><br>

                <h2>Mountain Lion</h2>
                <img src="images/mountainlion.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you get in a close encounter with a mountain lion, make sure that you put yourself in the role of a predator.
                Standing close with your friends, waving your hands, and shouting should scare the animal and you will be safe. Whatever
                you do, do not run away from it, since it will run after you and attack you.</p><br>
             
                <h2>Wolf</h2>
                <img src="images/wolf.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Same as the mountain lion, if you spot a wolf or a pack of wolfs, make sure you stand tall and big, open your jacket,
                wave your hands, and make lots of noises, or just slowly back away from them. The wolf attack very rarely, and they are
                not so aggressive as the other animals on this list and as media and films make out.</p><br>

                <h2>Bobcat</h2>
                <img src="images/bobcat.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you see a bobcat near, make sure you protect your children, since they often attack smaller prey. If the animal is
                still, just remain calm yourself, make an eye contact with it, and slowly back away. In the case of the bobcat attacking
                you, make yourself as big as possible, defend with everything you got, and make sure you protect your head and throat.</p><br>


                <h2>Coyote</h2>
                <img src="images/coyote.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Make sure you avoid hiking at dusk since the coyotes tend to appear at that time, and if you see one, do not approach
                it. If a coyote is preparing to attack, you will hear it barking, rearing on its hind legs, or following you on your
                path. So, to defend yourself, you should make loud noises, scream, yell, clap, or throw something at its directions,
                like water, rocks, etc.</p><br>

                <h2>Moose</h2>
                <img src="images/moose.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Unlike situations with other wild animals, if you get attacked by a moose, you should run as fast as you can, although
                it is very hard to outrun a moose. Also, try to find a tree to climb or somewhere to cover from the attack. If the
                animal knocks you down, make sure you curl into a ball and cover your head with your arms, and wait for the moose to go
                away.</p><br>

                <h2>Snake</h2>
                <img src="images/snake.jpg" alt="">
                <p>If you are walking on the trail, the chances of getting in an encounter with a snake are very small, since they tend to
                stay away from noises and people. If, by chance, you see a snake crossing your path, make sure you stop walking, remain
                calm, and let the snake go away. The snake will not attack if it’s not feeling threatened by you.</p><br>

            <h2>FAQ's</h2>
        </div>
      
        <button class="accordion">How to handle wild animals?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>You might find yourself in a situation where the cavalry isn't anywhere near you. Your first priority is the safety of
            those affected by their proximity to the animal, including yourself. You need to keep people away from the area and try 
            your very best to limit the animal's movements. In other words, make every effort to contain the animal until you can 
            figure out what to do. The last thing you want is the animal leaving your position and heading deeper into a
            neighborhood or vanishing completely only to resurface as a new threat a few hours later.
        <br><br>
        What to do once you have it contained will depend on what animal you are dealing with, what type of training you have
        had, and who will end up dealing with the animal. There will be times when creativity and thinking out of the box will
        rule the day. Sometimes that means throwing a garbage can over a snake. Other times it's as easy as closing a door or a
        fence gate. And then there will be times when you just redirect traffic, keep gawkers away, and keep eyes on the animal
        from a safe distance.
        <br><br>
        There is nothing wrong with holding what you have until a supervisor arrives to take over. What options you have will
        depend upon your agency policy and the help available from your local community. I have handled many calls where someone
        in the neighborhood knew more about dealing with the animal than I did. Don't be afraid to reach out to anyone who can
        help you formulate a plan.
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">What are the things that you need to do first upon seeing such animals?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Don't panic if you come across an animal unexpectedly. If you panic, the wild animal could misinterpret it as an
            offensive act. Most wild animals, regardless of size, will not attack unless they feel threatened, have their offspring
            with them, or are injured or sick.
            <br><br>
            Don't box the animal in and try to contain it until you are ready to do so and can do it safely. If you are not ready to
            act, give the animal a way to escape. It is safer to do this than to corner a wild animal and have to fight it. For
            example, I have seen instances where wild hogs have injured hunters and their dogs because the hog felt it was cornered.
            Bigger animals like bears will fight to the death in order to escape so don't give it a reason to think it's in danger.
            <br><br>
            Stay calm, and move away slowly and quietly. Keep an eye on the animal until you are safely away. The more distance
            between the animal and you, the better. Once you are safe, then you can regroup and enact your plan.
            <br><br>
            The reality is that most law enforcement officers are ill equipped to handle anything but the simplest of wild animal
            calls. The best way to handle any wild animal is to call someone who has the experience and training to do so.</p>
        </div>
        
        <button class="accordion">What is the importance of wild animals? they can be protected?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The importance of wild animals does not depend on how much they can produce for us. They are important because they all
            even each other out into a balanced and effective ecosystem, along with abiotic factors. The apex predators are the most
            important, because they act as a governing body of sorts for the ecosystem. They make sure that none of the prey eat too
            many plants, or have offspring beyond the carrying capacity of the ecosystem. Without them, as seen in Yellowstone
            National Park with elk after the wolves there were slowly killed off by humans, the preys’ numbers will get out of hand,
            and they will decimate the plant populations, causing devastating trophic cascades that effect all biotic and abiotic
            factors in the ecosystem. The prey and supporting predators are also very important, because the predators obviously all
            depend on the prey to live, and the supporting predators might keep other prey populations in check. No one knows what
            the overall purpose of all wild animals is, and there might not be one, but in my opinion, they are important anyway
            because they all have lives, and they all support a very organized system.</p>
